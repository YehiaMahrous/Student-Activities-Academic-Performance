# Student-Activities-Academic-Performance
## Description
This project analyzes the relationship between extracurricular activities and academic performance among students. It uses data visualization and statistical analysis to understand how involvement in extracurricular activities affects students' GPAs and other academic factors.

## Features
Load and preprocess data from an Excel file.
Calculate and compare average GPAs for students involved and not involved in extracurricular activities.
Visualize data using bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, and boxplots.
Perform linear regression analysis.
Generate frequency charts and analyze correlations.

## Requirements
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
scipy
seaborn

## Installation
Clone the repository:
'git clone https://github.com/yehiamahrous/student-activities-academic-performance.git'

Navigate to the project directory:
'cd student-activities-analysis'

Install the required packages:
'pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn scipy seaborn'

## Usage
Ensure the data file Student Activities and Academic Performance Data.xlsx is in the project directory.
Run the script:
'python analysis.py'

## Code Overview
Load the Excel file into a DataFrame and preprocess the data by extracting relevant columns.
Calculate the average GPA and standard deviation for students involved and not involved in extracurricular activities.
Visualize the average GPA by extracurricular activities involvement using a bar chart.
Create a scatter plot with a linear regression line to analyze the relationship between time spent on extracurricular activities and GPA.
Generate a pie chart to show the distribution of students by gender.
Visualize the impact of extracurricular activities on GPA using a bar chart.
Use a boxplot to display the distribution of CGPA by satisfaction with academic performance.
Generate frequency charts for gender and involvement in extracurricular activities, and bar charts for mean GPA by gender and involvement.
Analyze correlations between satisfaction, time spent, perceived impact, and GPA using scatter plots and boxplots.
Display the distribution of GPA using a histogram.
